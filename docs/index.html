        <h3>Synthetic monitoring to enable automatic outage mitigation</h3>
        <h4>Citrix 2021</h4>
        <p>
          As part of an effort to replace our manual outage mitigation process
          with an automated system I created Synthetic Monitoring scripts. We
          ran these scripts via New relic against our production and internal
          environments to create live continuous E2E testing and alerting. This
          alerting was consumed by a health monitoring service that could
          respond to outages in specific synthetics by changing traffic manager
          rules to route traffic away from dysfunctional instances. The
          automatic outage resolution effort as a whole brought my team's owned
          services from 99.9% to 99.985% uptime.
