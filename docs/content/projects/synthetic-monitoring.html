<h3>Synthetic monitoring to enable automatic outage mitigation</h3>
<h4>Citrix 2021</h4>
<p>
  As part of an effort to replace our manual outage mitigation process with an
  automated system I created Synthetic Monitoring scripts. We ran these scripts
  via New relic against our production and internal environments to create live
  continuous E2E testing and alerting. This alerting was consumed by a health
  monitoring service that could respond to outages in specific synthetics by
  changing traffic manager rules to route traffic away from dysfunctional
  instances. The automatic outage resolution effort as a whole brought my team's
  owned services from 99.9% to 99.985% uptime.
